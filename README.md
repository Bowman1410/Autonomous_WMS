# Autonomous_WMS
## Project Overview
The Autonomous Warehouse Management System is a full-stack application integrated with a physical robot, designed to automate various warehouse operations like inventory management, order picking, and placing. This system uses robotics for autonomous navigation, computer vision for item detection, and data science techniques for optimization and predictive maintenance.

# Features
* Autonomous Robot Navigation: A mobile robot equipped with sensors and cameras that autonomously navigates the warehouse, avoiding obstacles and reaching specified destinations.
* Inventory Management: A backend system that tracks inventory levels and assigns tasks to the robot to pick or place items.
* Task Optimization: Data-driven algorithms that optimize robot routes, minimize task time, and predict inventory demand.
* Real-Time Data Monitoring: A frontend dashboard to track robot status, warehouse tasks, and inventory updates in real-time.
